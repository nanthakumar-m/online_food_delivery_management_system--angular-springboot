# 🍽️ Online Food Delivery Management System  – Angular + Spring Boot

A full-stack web application that simulates an online food ordering and delivery system. It  allows users to explore menus, place  orders, make payments securely, 
and track their delivery status and restaurants can register themselves and showcase their menu items and update them continously. Built with Angular (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend), the system features robust security with JWT authentication and smooth online payments via Stripe integration.
